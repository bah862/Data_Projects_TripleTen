# Data_Projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | EDA Spreadsheet Analysis Project | This project task was to analyze Airbnb user data and find the most attractive Airbnb rentals and calculate the annual revenue for each location |
| 2 | Business Analytics Spreadsheet Project | The project task was to build a conversion funnel, separate our users into acquistion cohorts, and finally calculate the retention rates for each of our cohorts by month. |
| 3 | Data Visualization with Tableau | This project uses Tableau to analyze an Excel dataset with information from a national superstore.  Our goal is to build several visualizations to identify the important centers on profit and loss, identify which 3 geographic locations and month of the year to advertise in, and find which products and customers have an abnormal rate of return. |
| 4 | Storytelling with Data |  |
