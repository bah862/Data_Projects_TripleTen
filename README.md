# Data_Projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Business Intelligence Analytics TripleTen Bootcamp.


| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [EDA Spreadsheet Analysis Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfnxzn8ylNHeF6S5_YPu-JAlUoyrDDzSp0bBzLEtDHg/edit?usp=sharing) | This project task was to analyze Airbnb user data and find the most attractive Airbnb rentals and calculate the annual revenue for each location |
| 2 | Business Analytics Spreadsheet Project | The project task was to build a conversion funnel, separate our users into acquistion cohorts, and finally calculate the retention rates for each of our cohorts by month. |
| 3 | Data Visualization with Tableau | This project uses Tableau to analyze an Excel dataset with information from a national superstore.  Our goal is to build several visualizations to identify the important centers on profit and loss, identify which 3 geographic locations and month of the year to advertise in, and find which products and customers have an abnormal rate of return. |
| 4 | Storytelling with Data | This project uses Tableau to analyze a large dataset with information from a national superstore, and using this data to identify root causes of returns and coming up with solutions to lower return rate.  Next we created a fully user-interative dashboard showing our conclusions and results for how the superstore can reduce returns.  Finally I created a screen-recording showcasing how to use the dashboard correctly and explaining to the audience the conculsions and results I arrived at. |
| 5 | Final Project | In this project, I was given 5 large datasets for a restaurant aggregator and food delivery company called Zomato.  I was asked to perform a Customer Analysis on the data to find out who Zomato's customers are, what is their purchasing behavior, and come up with any other insights I can draw from the data.  I used Power BI to generate my charts and plots and eventually used the software to create and interactive dashboard displaying my results and conclusions. |
